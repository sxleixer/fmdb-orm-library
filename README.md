<h1>fmdb-orm-library</h1>
fmdb-orm-library is an iOS (probably even MacOS, thus not tested yet) ORM library. It is taking the FMDB SQLite Database Handler to the next level. And perfectly integrates the ORM approach into the FMDatabase environments generating a minimum of object handling overhead by caching frequently used parts.

The library uses ARC so if you want to use it in a non-ARC project you will have to set the compiler-flag <code>-fobjc-arc</code> to the FMDBORM*-Classes.
